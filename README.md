## 🚀 Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is using Docker:

### Standard Installation (with Traefik)

Standard installation with automatic SSL configuration via Traefik:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.flexibuckets.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Installation without Traefik

For Kubernetes, Coolify, Dokploy, or environments where you manage your own SSL/proxy:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flexibuckets/flexibuckets.git
cd flexibuckets

# Use the no-Traefik configuration
cp scripts/docker/docker-compose.no-traefik.yml docker-compose.yml

# Start the services
docker compose up -d
```

For more details, see the [No Traefik Installation Guide](scripts/docker/README.md).

The installation will:

⚠️ Security Note: The auto-update feature requires mounting the Docker socket and 
granting certain privileges to the container. This is necessary for the application 
to manage its own updates, but it does mean the container has elevated permissions 
on your system. If this is a concern, you can disable auto-updates and manage 
updates manually. Currently, the auto-update feature is WIP.
